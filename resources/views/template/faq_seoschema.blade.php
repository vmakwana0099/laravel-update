KVM runs directly on the bare-metal using the Linux kernel, ensuring near-native performance.

Your CPU, RAM, and storage are yours alone, which means no sharing and slowdowns!
KVM leverages SELinux and sVirt for strong isolation, which reduces vulnerabilities.
Since you have dedicated resources, your website or app runs faster and smoother.
As each VPS is isolated, your server stays safe even if others face issues.
It allows seamless migration of VMs between servers with minimal downtime."
